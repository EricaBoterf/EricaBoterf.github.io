  <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
    Hi, I’m <span class="font-semibold text-brand">Erica Boterf</span>, a Computer Science student at SNHU with a focus on 
    <span class="font-semibold text-brand">data analysis</span>, 
    <span class="font-semibold text-brand">software design</span>, and 
    <span class="font-semibold text-brand">web development</span>.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
    I love building projects that turn ideas into real tools and experiences. Whether it’s 
    C++, Java, Python, or SQL, I enjoy learning new languages and applying them to solve problems.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
    Beyond schoolwork, I contribute to GitHub, create tutorials, and explore new frameworks. 
    My goal is to use technology to make a positive difference while constantly sharpening my skills.
